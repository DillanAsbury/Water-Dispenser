# Arduino-bottle
Arduino controlled baby/water bottle filling station.
________________________________________________
This code in tandem with the hardware specified below will allow you to create a water filling station that has the ability to a set number of ounces. Currently, the code supports a range of one to nine ounces in one pour, however, you can edit the code to pour as much as you like. Also, the code is written so that you cannot spam the button. If you want to pour the same amount multiple times, you have to switch the rotary encoder forward or backward to reset the program (this is my homemade child proofing). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
